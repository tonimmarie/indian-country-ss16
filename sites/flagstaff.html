         <h3>Suicide Among Native Youth</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Our nation’s children,  from around the ages of new teens to young adults, all suffer from internal problems usually stemming from social standard put upon them by modern media.  The stress this age group is found under, as well as the expectations older communities hold for them, can lead to an unstable mind.  This is where suicide enters the picture.  Specifically, Native American communities are known to deal with issues of suicide in their teenage population.  As of recently, many of these Native communities have made it a point to bring this tragedy to the surface by creating multiple websites for teens with specifically Native backgrounds who are dealing with these mental struggles.  The goals of these programs are to address this problem and offer opportunities for the teens in these communities, as well as their families, to tend to the root of the suicides.</p>

		 <p>The adamant push for suicide prevention is centered in Arizona, and effectively impacting the Native communities in the state.  One in particular, based in Flagstaff, has a beautiful website that deals with a number of possible family and personal struggles with suicide prevention being a top priority.  According to the Flagstaff community’s website, suicide is the second leading cause of death, in Arizona, for those of ages 15 to 34 (NACA, 2016) <!--turn this citaion into a link!-->

		<h3>The Real Reason For Native Suicides?</h3>
		<hr>
		 <p>In regards to the research done explicitly for Native tribes and communities, the reasons an individual would contemplate suicide seem endless.  A fairly constant occurrence is the relation of substance abuse and the attempts, or successes that have happened in the past among the population.  It so happens to be that alcohol was involved in 69% of these completed suicides (Suicide and Religion, 2009).<!--Cite!-->  The most interesting reason for attempted suicide among the Native Americans is their loss of cultural identity.  North America’s Indian communities have struggled ever since the English have settled on the East Coast in 1748.  Working hard in order to avoid being torn from their cultural roots.  After assimilation, coupled with problems of communities no longer being recognized by the American government, the Native people had to fight to be seen as “authentic”.</p>
