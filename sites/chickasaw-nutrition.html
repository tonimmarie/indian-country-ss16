     <h3>Nutritional Issues Leading to Diabetes and What is Being Done to Combat this Health Issue</h3>
     <h4>Lucy Grogan</h4>
     	<h3>Introduction</h3>
     	<hr>
		<p>The issues of nutrition and food type within the Chickasaw Nation, located in Oklahoma, are plenty.  Before settlers came to Chickasaw territory, they were an “aboriginal” people (Clark 1976) whom depended on the land for many things, including sustenance.  But after selling some of their land to the government to pay back a debt and having to deal with settlers stealing other parts of their land, they had to turn to farming to sustain themselves (Clark 1976).  Currently, type 2 diabetes is a major health issue within the Chickasaw Nation.  This serious health problem stems from the types of food these people are now being provided to eat. </p>
<br>

		<h3>History</h3>

		 </figure>
		<p>Before white settlers laid claim to land that was not theirs, the Chickasaw people inhabited the area of what is now Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/7/16).  They traveled with the game they hunted, and had uses for the entire animal: food, clothing, shelter, weaponry, and trade to name the main uses.  In other words, nothing was wasted (Thomas 2011).</p>
		<p>The Chickasaw people had laws and religion that made up their complex system of ruling, and were considered by white settlers as one of the “Five Civilized Tribes” for this reason (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/7/16).  Between 1786-1818, there were many factors that led to the removal of the Chickasaws no longer being met with resistance.  One of these factors that contributed to resistance dissipating was the vast amount of white settlers that were taxing the land and the game that could be hunted.  Without their normal hunting lands, or game to hunt, the Chickasaw people had to turn to farming in order to provide themselves with food.  Men and women farmed together, which was in opposition and degrading to the warrior status that the men prided themselves on; it served as a connection to their heritage (Clark 1976).  </p>
		<p>The Treaty of Doaksville (1837) dictated that the Chickasaw people would be removed from their homeland and resettled on to Choctaw lands in “Indian Territory” (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/7/16).  So, they were among the people who were forced to travel the “Trail of Tears” from their homelands to Oklahoma, where they formed a separate government away from the Choctaws in 1856 and accepted their new constitution in 1983 (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/7/16).  </p>

		<p>The Chickasaw people used to travel a vast area to hunt game, but once they were removed they became more sedentary within the borders of the reservation.  Instead of eating wild game, they are eating the highly processed foods that are being supplied to them through their government funded assistance programs and today’s food market.  This change in diet and lifestyle greatly contribute to the decline in the overall health of the people in the Chickasaw Nation. </p>

		<h3>Health Issue</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>From 1832 to 1939, based on medical reports put together by physicians from the military, diabetes was not present in the native population that was located in Oklahoma (West, 1974).  Now, however, diabetes affects 16% percent of native peoples, while national rates have only 7.6% of people (whites, non-Hispanic) recorded as having diabetes (Patchell and Edwards 2014).  With this high of a percentage of people affected, diabetes is the main health concern for both adults and children of the Chickasaw Nation.  For this reason, testing for diabetes is a common practice for Chickasaw people (Parker et al. 2011).  </p>
<br>
		<h3> Moving Forward: What is Being Done to Combat Diabetes?</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>The programs that have been and continue to be formed and put in place are aimed at involving the whole community with “family-based education” that not only involves the general population of the tribe, but also the tribal leaders and elders helping to promote diabetes prevention (Parker et al. 2011). It is imperative that this approach is appropriate for the Chickasaw culture in order to be successful.  One idea, proposed by an individual of the Chickasaw Nation who was interviewed in the experiment conducted by Parker et al. (2011), for the prevention of diabetes was having cooking classes for children and creating cook books so that people, including kids, will be educated on how to cook the foods that they are provided with in a healthier and simple manner (Parker et al.  2011).  </p>
		<p>One way that such cooking classes and materials are being created is through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Education Program, or SNAP-Ed for short.  This program provides funding to put on educational programs such as the Get Fresh! Program (OSU Final Report, 2010) and The Eagle Adventure Program (Eagle Adventure, 4/8/16).  Both of these programs are aimed at educating adults and children in how to eat in a healthier manner and steps that can be taken to prevent the development of diabetes.  </p>

		 <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Image 4. Get Fresh! Program">Image 4</a> Get Fresh! Program Logo </figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <p>The Get Fresh! Program is a nutritional education program that was created by the Chickasaw Nation in conjunction with the USDA.  It promotes healthy methods of preparing food via monthly cooking shows that are informative while also being entertaining <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Welcome To the Chickasaw Nation The Official Site Of the Chickasaw Nation. http://www.chickasaw.net/, accessed March 12, 2016.">(Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/9/16)</a>.  Education programs about nutrition are also provided for schools and other “youth organizations” through this Get Fresh! Program (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/9/16), so not only adults but also children are involved in the improvement of nutrition within the Chickasaw Nation.  The Get Fresh! Program uses “interactive cooking classes, food demonstrations, interactive classroom lessons and health fairs” to teach about nutritional ways of cooking and eating (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/9/16). </p>

		 <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Image 5. Eagle Adventure">Image 5</a> The Eagle Adventure Program </figcaption>
		 </figure>
		<p>The Eagle Adventure program has been running since February 2010, and is aimed at teaching children how to prevent developing type 2 diabetes through improving their health via better nutrition (Eagle Adventure Program, 4/8/16).  The “Eagle Books”, courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as employing the traditional style of storytelling done by Native Americans are the ways that this program aims to educate children and their families on not only nutrition, but also on the role that physical activity plays in the prevention of diabetes (Eagle Adventure Program, 4/8/16).   </p>
		
		<p>Finally, a newer program that supplies funding for food to the Chickasaw people is the Online “Chickasaw Nation Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program (WIC)” which employs the use of an Electronic Benefit Transfer card (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/9/16).  This EBT card allows parents and caregivers to buy nutritional food for their children in a manner that is simpler than the traditional paper way (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/9/16).  The Chickasaw nation is working with JP Morgan (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/9/16) to bring these EBT cards to low-income families so they have the ability to buy nutritional food, which is necessary to help stop the problem of both children and adults developing diabetes, as well as to keep those who already have diabetes healthy.  The WIC program also uses software called “SPIRIT” that helps to collect data on the eligibility of someone for the program as well as any nutritional risk(s) they have (Chickasaw Tribal Website, 4/9/16).  </p>
